4.2.3 Mode message

      Command: MODE

   The MODE command is a dual-purpose command in IRC.  It allows both
   usernames and channels to have their mode changed.  The rationale for
   this choice is that one day nicknames will be obsolete and the
   equivalent property will be the channel.

   When parsing MODE messages, it is recommended that the entire message
   be parsed first and then the changes which resulted then passed on.

4.2.3.1 Channel modes

   Parameters: <channel> {[+|-]|o|p|s|i|t|n|b|v} [<limit>] [<user>]
               [<ban mask>]

   The MODE command is provided so that channel operators may change the
   characteristics of `their' channel.  It is also required that servers
   be able to change channel modes so that channel operators may be
   created.

   The various modes available for channels are as follows:

           o - give/take channel operator privileges;
           p - private channel flag;
           s - secret channel flag;
           i - invite-only channel flag;
           t - topic settable by channel operator only flag;
           n - no messages to channel from clients on the outside;
           m - moderated channel;
           l - set the user limit to channel;

RFC 1459              Internet Relay Chat Protocol              May 1993


           b - set a ban mask to keep users out;
           v - give/take the ability to speak on a moderated channel;
           k - set a channel key (password).

   When using the 'o' and 'b' options, a restriction on a total of three
   per mode command has been imposed.  That is, any combination of 'o'
   and

4.2.3.2 User modes

   Parameters: <nickname> {[+|-]|i|w|s|o}

   The user MODEs are typically changes which affect either how the
   client is seen by others or what 'extra' messages the client is sent.
   A user MODE command may only be accepted if both the sender of the
   message and the nickname given as a parameter are both the same.

   The available modes are as follows:

           i - marks a users as invisible;
           s - marks a user for receipt of server notices;
           w - user receives wallops;
           o - operator flag.

   Additional modes may be available later on.

   If a user attempts to make themselves an operator using the "+o"
   flag, the attempt should be ignored.  There is no restriction,
   however, on anyone `deopping' themselves (using "-o").  Numeric
